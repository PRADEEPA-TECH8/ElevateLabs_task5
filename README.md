# Task 5: Decision Trees and Random Forests

## 🔍 Objective
Train and evaluate Decision Tree and Random Forest models on a classification dataset using Scikit-learn.

## 📊 Dataset
- Dataset: Heart Disease Dataset from Kaggle
- Features: age, sex, chest pain type (cp), cholesterol (chol), etc.
- Target: presence of heart disease (0 or 1)

## 🛠 Tools Used
- Python 3.10
- Scikit-learn
- Graphviz
- Matplotlib, Seaborn

## ✅ What I Did
- Trained a full decision tree
- Visualized the tree using Graphviz
- Pruned the tree to reduce overfitting
- Trained a Random Forest classifier
- Compared model accuracy
- Interpreted feature importances
- Used cross-validation for robust evaluation

## 📈 Results
| Model | Accuracy |
|-------|----------|
| Decision Tree | 0.985 |
| Pruned Tree | 0.800 |
| Random Forest | 0.985 |
| CV Accuracy | ~0.997 |
